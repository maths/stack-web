<h1 id="transforming-mathematics-education-in-africa-the-impact-of-the-innodems-stack-internship-programme">Transforming Mathematics Education in Africa: The Impact of the INNODEMS STACK Internship Programme</h1>
<p>Authors: Juma Zevick and Santiago Borio.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The adoption of STACK, an online assessment system for mathematics and other STEM courses in African universities, has been driven by the need for efficient assessment solutions, limited resources, and increasing student enrollment. To support the implementation of STACK and enhance mathematics education in Africa, IDEMS International and its Kenyan counterpart INNODEMS have collaborated to establish the INNODEMS STACK Internship Programme. This programme has trained a local team of interns who have successfully integrated STACK into undergraduate courses in universities across Africa. Through their training in STACK question authoring, technical support, and professional skills development, the intern team has played a vital role in the effective implementation of STACK in African universities. The programme has yielded positive results in Kenya, at Maseno University, Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, and Ethiopian universities where it is used in supporting students through a remedial program at Bahir Dar University. Challenges such as technical complexities, limited resources, and cultural contextual factors have been overcome through collaboration, regular training, knowledge sharing, and adaptability. The next steps involve expanding the internship programme, continuous capacity building, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, and securing additional funding to further support the implementation of STACK in African universities.</p>

<h2 id="context-and-motivation">Context and Motivation</h2>
<p>STACK has gained significant attention and interest in African universities. This growing interest is primarily driven by the system's unique capability to address challenges associated with limited resources, large class sizes, and the demand for effective assessment solutions that enhance student learning. STACK provides African universities a powerful tool to overcome these challenges and improve the quality of mathematics education across the continent. IDEMS International, a UK-registered not-for-profit community interest company, in collaboration with its Kenyan counterpart INNODEMS, has actively supported African universities in adopting and implementing STACK in undergraduate courses.</p>

<p>The initial observations made during the first IDEMS-led STACK workshop held in Maseno University, Kenya, in 2019, and subsequent workshops in 2022 at Maseno university and in 2023 in Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia, highlighted a growing interest and enthusiasm for the adoption and use of STACK in African academic institutions. These workshops served as valuable platforms for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and capacity building, fostering a supportive environment for STACK implementation.</p>

<p>Recognising the potential of STACK to transform mathematics education, IDEMS, in collaboration with Maseno University and Masinde Muliro University for Science and Technology (MMUST) in Kenya, identified priority courses where STACK assessments could replace or complement traditional pen and paper assignments. These assignments were challenging to mark and provide timely feedback for due to the large class sizes, sometimes exceeding 1,000 students, with limited or no additional support.</p>

<p>Initially, IDEMS directly created the STACK resources for these courses. However, as the demand for STACK adoption grew, the need for a local team of experts became evident. To meet this demand, an internship program was implemented, recruiting four Kenyan recent graduates who had prior experience using STACK during their undergraduate studies. These interns, along with two local contractors from IDEMS, formed a team and received comprehensive training from three experienced members of IDEMS to support the integration of STACK in higher learning institutions.</p>

<p>The adoption of STACK assessments in African universities has emerged as a response to the pressing challenges faced by these institutions. With limited resources and the need for efficient assessment solutions, the collaboration between IDEMS International, INNODEMS, and African universities aims to enhance mathematics education by harnessing the power of STACK to improve learning outcomes and provide a more inclusive and accessible educational experience for students.</p>

<p>STACK has gained significant attention and interest in African universities. This growing interest is primarily driven by the system's unique capability to address challenges associated with limited resources, large class sizes, and the demand for effective assessment solutions that enhance student learning. STACK provides African universities with the opportunity to overcome  these challenges and improve the quality of mathematics education across the continent. IDEMS International, a UK-registered not-for-profit community interest company, in collaboration with its Kenyan counterpart INNODEMS, has actively supported African universities in adopting and implementing STACK in undergraduate courses.</p>

<p>The initial observations made during the first IDEMS-led STACK workshop held in Maseno University, Kenya, in 2019, and subsequent workshops in 2022 at Maseno University and in 2023 in Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia, highlighted a growing interest and enthusiasm for the adoption and use of STACK in African academic institutions. These workshops served as valuable platforms for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and capacity building, fostering a supportive environment for STACK implementation.</p>

<p>Recognising the potential of STACK to transform mathematics education, IDEMS, in collaboration with Maseno University and Masinde Muliro University for Science and Technology (MMUST) in Kenya, identified priority courses where STACK assessments could replace or complement traditional pen and paper assignments. These assignments were challenging to mark and provide timely feedback for due to the large class sizes, sometimes exceeding 1,000 students, with limited or no additional support.</p>

<p>Initially, IDEMS directly created the STACK resources for these courses. However, as the demand for STACK adoption grew, the need for a local team of experts became evident. To meet this demand, an internship program was initiated, recruiting four Kenyan recent graduates with prior experience using STACK while students during their undergraduate studies. These interns, along with two local contractors from IDEMS, formed a team and received comprehensive training from three experienced members of IDEMS to support the integration of STACK in higher learning institutions.
STACK allows educators to automate assessments with immediate feedback, enabling efficient handling of large class sizes and promoting a more engaging learning experience. The collaboration between IDEMS, INNODEMS, and African universities aims to enhance mathematics education by harnessing the power of STACK to improve learning outcomes and provide a more inclusive and accessible educational experience for students.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-training-and-capacity-building">Dynamic Training and Capacity Building</h2>
<p>The one-year-long internship programme started in July 2022 and was managed by INNODEMS with training provided by IDEMS. To enhance understanding and proficiency in STACK effectively, the team participated in two weekly meetings and practical sessions led remotely by the IDEMS team from the UK and Austria, and two opportunistic week-long in-person sprints. This training provided an opportunity to leverage the collective knowledge and experiences of the team members, enabling them to offer comprehensive support for the implementation of STACK in different learning environments.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Training session for the local intern team during a sprint</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>The training program was intentionally designed to be dynamic, with a focus on creating content for undergraduate mathematics courses that were considered high-priority due to their significant enrolment and unique role in providing foundational knowledge for other subsequent courses that students are likely to take. This content was promptly made available to students at Maseno University and MMUST as soon as it was developed, ensuring a continuous and responsive learning experience for the students using the STACK platform. Carefully planned workflows, peer review of each new question, and a further review stage by more experienced authors facilitated by carefully adapted project management tools meant that three new courses integrated STACK assessments in the first semester of the 22-23 academic year, with a further 5 courses in the second semester.
The training focused on practical learning and capacity building, with three priority areas: STACK authoring, Moodle management, and the development of professional skills. This led to the following outputs by the intern team:</p>

<ol>
<li>Authoring and reviewing STACK questions. The team learned how to create, review, and improve questions, ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the assessment materials, and smooth functionality and optimal support for students. The team was trained in developing a repository of questions that can be openly accessed and are being used by various local universities in Africa, with over 20 universities demonstrating interest recently. The repository includes open question banks in six areas of undergraduate mathematics with an average of 150 questions each, expanding the availability of resources for STACK implementation.</li>

<li>Technical support for Kenyan and Ethiopian universities. The team gained expertise in providing technical assistance to universities using STACK. This included tasks such as exporting and uploading STACK questions, managing courses, handling user access and permissions, and facilitating communication within the platform. Notably, Maseno University and MMUST have already benefited from this support and integrated STACK in at least 13 courses with questions from the open question banks, and recently, Ethiopian universities have also sought assistance from the local team for a remedial pre-university course and a foundational mathematics course compulsory to all undergraduate students.</li>

<li>Professional skills. The interns' training encompassed valuable professional skills, complementing their technical knowledge. They honed effective communication, organisational, and transferable skills, such as programming within others. They learned to convey complex concepts clearly, manage tasks efficiently, and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders. They also gained experience in collaborative project management tools.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="success-stories">Success stories</h2>
<p>The implementation of STACK in African universities, supported by the Internship Programme, has yielded promising results and success stories. These highlight the positive impact of integrating STACK into higher education institutions across Africa. The collaborative efforts between INNODEMS, IDEMS International, and local universities have contributed to the effective implementation and utilisation of STACK, ultimately enhancing the quality of mathematics education and supporting student success.</p>

<h4>Maseno University</h4>

<p>In 2022, Maseno University added four additional undergraduate mathematics courses to its list of seven courses with fully developed online STACK resources developed through the support of the local team: Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Integral Calculus (Calculus II), Linear Algebra II, and Complex Analysis II. These courses have complemented the existing seven courses already developed at Maseno, including Differential Calculus (Calculus I), Descriptive Statistics, Basic Mathematics, Vector Analysis, Complex Analysis I, Measure Theory, and Linear Algebra I. Incorporation of STACK in these courses has enriched the learning experience for students and transformed the way assessment and learning is done at Maseno. </p>

<p><i>‚ÄúIn 2018, I returned to Maseno after six years of PhD studies in the USA. One of my new responsibilities was teaching undergraduate maths classes and was immediately overwhelmed by the task. My first class was an introduction to Linear algebra that had 1000 students and I did not have any support in terms of teaching assistants. Clearly, giving homework, marking it, and giving immediate personalised feedback was going to be impossible, unless we innovated. The first time teaching the course, I used the traditional paper-based continuous assessment and I had a challenge marking. The next time I taught the course, I used STACK questions and was able to give weekly homework assignments and my students received immediate feedback which promoted learning on their part. Most students were very happy with the intervention and some expressed their hope of having more courses taught and their formative assessment done using STACK. Some students thought that it was too much work since they were used to only a few questions a semester in the form of continuous assessment. On my part as the course lecturer, I was greatly relieved since I could monitor student progress on a weekly basis and tailor my lectures accordingly. Formative assessment was easier and the exam performance for students that used STACK was much improved. I think it is a great tool that can support the teaching and learning of mathematics, especially in our situations where class sizes are too large and the support for teaching is nonexistent.‚Äù</i> (Dr. Michael Oyiengo, Maseno University)</p>

<h4>Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) </h4>

<p>Similarly, MMUST has successfully integrated STACK into five courses thanks to the efforts of the local team: Analytical Geometry, Advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra II, Complex Analysis II, and Vector Analysis, as well as using others developed for other universities with matching curricula. These courses now leverage the interactive features and personalised assessments provided by STACK, enhancing student engagement and understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>

<p><i>‚ÄúThe academic year 2022/23 marked a significant turning point for MMUST in terms of delivery of mathematics courses. The Department of Mathematics was able to integrate STACK in the delivery of 8 courses. The implementation challenges notwithstanding, the support of interns in authoring the questions was incredible.
The presentations by MMUST lecturers at the just-ended first African STACK conference was very revealing in terms of the impact of STACK on the teaching and learning experience. It was evidently clear that the integration of STACK in course delivery is positively correlated with student performance. We can't thank IDEMS enough for the support offered so far. We plan to upscale the integration of STACK in our courses in the coming academic year. In this regard, we are counting on the continued support from the interns.‚Äù</i> (Prof. George Lawi, MMUST)</p>

<h4> Ethiopia </h4>

<p>The Ethiopian Remedial Programme has seen significant progress through the implementation of STACK. The intern team, in collaboration with Bahir Dar University, has played a crucial role in developing STACK resources specifically tailored for the program. These resources have provided remedial students with interactive learning materials, formative assessments, and personalised feedback, enabling them to strengthen their mathematical skills and increase their chances of successfully entering university. Full curriculum coverage was achieved by the team in a 6 weeks period. The focus has now shifted to the Mathematics for Natural Sciences and Mathematics for Social Sciences courses that are compulsory to all undergraduate students irrespective of the subject of their studies and will be made available to all Ethiopian universities.<p>

</p><i>"Our journey with STACK began after attending a transformative workshop at Maseno University in 2019. Witnessing our students' remarkable progress using IDEMS-developed assessments for the 'Linear Algebra' course inspired us to embrace STACK in our teaching and assessments. We have since integrated STACK into our education system, offering personalized and immediate feedback, enhancing self-paced learning, and empowering our students to succeed.
Our fruitful collaboration with IDEMS led to the successful implementation of a STACK-based Remedial Program, providing crucial support to a large number of students. As we continue our partnership, we are developing an online Mathematics support course for Natural and Social Sciences. The vast number of first-year students enrolled in this course spread across different campuses, demands innovative solutions, and STACK enables us to deliver timely guidance and support. Looking ahead, we are eager to leverage STACK's potential for the national exit exam, a crucial requirement for our final-year undergraduate students. We aim to provide invaluable preparation tools for this significant exam. Together with IDEMS, we are paving the way for a brighter future in mathematics education at Bahir Dar University."</i> (Mebratu Fenta Wakeni, Bahir Dar University)</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>The implementation of STACK and the internship programme in African universities presented several challenges for the local team. These challenges can be categorised under the following themes:</p>

<p><strong>Technical Challenges</strong> - the team embraced the opportunity to learn programming languages such as LaTeX, HTML, and JavaScript, all of which were unfamiliar to them in the beginning. Though the learning curve was steep due to limited prior experience with these tools, through dedication and concerted effort, they progressively gained proficiency, allowing them to skillfully develop and implement STACK resources.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Resources</strong> - the interns team faced challenges due to limited resources, such as access to quality hardware and internet connectivity, which affected their speed and efficiency in meeting the growing demand for STACK implementation and support in African universities. To overcome these limitations, the team employed resourceful strategies by leveraging on the existing infrastructure, formed collaborative partnerships, optimised workflows, adapted STACK authoring to the local context, and provided training and capacity building. These approaches allowed them to make the most of available resources, find innovative solutions, and ensure the successful implementation of STACK despite resource constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Familiarisation</strong> - as STACK was a relatively new tool in the African educational context, the team faced the challenge of familiarising themselves with its functionalities, features, and best practices. They had to invest time and effort in understanding how to effectively integrate STACK into existing courses, design assessments, and provide appropriate feedback to students. This process required continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation to ensure the successful utilisation of STACK. A four-layer review of content created ensured the quality of the content created by the team.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural and Contextual Factors</strong> - the team had to consider the diverse educational backgrounds, teaching methodologies, and student learning styles across different African universities. Adapting STACK to suit these varied contexts and ensuring its alignment with local educational practices and requirements required careful consideration and collaboration with stakeholders.
Additionally, cultural differences between the UK, Austrian and Kenyan team members, coupled with remote training, meant that initially the learning was slow. Once cultural barriers were overcome, the training became more effective and efficient, leading to the successful development of a team of experts.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>The interns played a crucial role in the success of the first African STACK Conference for Undergraduate Mathematics, from 19 to 23 June 2023, held at MMUST, Kenya. They actively participated in the conference, presenting their experiences and insights gained from supporting the implementation of STACK in African universities, and played a key role in the facilitation of the workshops.</p>

<p>During the conference, it became evident that the internship program had immense potential for expansion and replication across Africa. The next steps identified after the conference include expanding the internship program to other African countries, providing continuous capacity building to the current interns to enable them to train and mentor new teams of interns, fostering collaboration among interns, and promoting knowledge sharing within the team. Additionally, there is a need to secure more funding to support the expansion and sustainability of the internship program, to ensure its reach and impact can be extended to more universities across the African continent.</p></div>
