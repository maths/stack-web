# About STACK

STACK is an online assessment system for mathematics and STEM, designed to enable students to answer questions with a mathematical expression, such as a polynomial. It is available for [Moodle](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack) and [ILIAS](https://github.com/ilifau/assStackQuestion/), and as an integration through [LTI](..MISSINGLINK).

<h4> Computer Algebra Support</h4>
STACK uses the Computer Algebra System Maxima to evaluate expressions.
<ul class="check">
	<li class="mb-3"><b>Mathematical answers:</b> questions are not limited to multiple choice.</li>
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Randomise questions</b> so different students see different variants of a quiz.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Graphical support:</b> make your questions stand out by integrating Maxima plots, JSXGraphs or Google Charts.
</ul>

#### Validation of answers
Before answers are graded, students confirm their answer is interpreted correctly by the system. Invalid answers, like ones with mismatched brackets, are rejected.
<ul class="check">
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Fair:</b> students are not penalised for poor computer skills.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Flexible:</b> the teacher decides what a valid answer looks like.
</ul>

#### Intelligent marking
Teachers write grading trees that mark answers based on mathematical properties, like "is it factored?"
<ul class="check">
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Specific feedback</b> tailored to each student's answer.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Multipart questions</b> with follow-through marking.
	</li>
	<li  class="mb-3"> <b>Give-example style questions</b> with many correct answers.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-3"> <b>Diverse question types</b> involving scientific units, numerical accuracy, line-by-line reasoning and more.
	</li>
</ul>
#### Open-source
As an open-source project, users help improve STACK by adding features, translations, bug reports and more.
