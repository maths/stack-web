# Translating STACK questions with AI

Georg Osang

### Abstract

This case study describes how we used the DeepL Translator, a neural machine translation service, in 2025 to automatically translate STACK questions from English to French and Italian, and from German to English.

### Motivation

The STACK community is large and growing, and one of its strengths is the wide international collaboration.  We have significant projects creating materials which are useful for students in languages other than then original.  Past projects, e.g. [IDIAM](../../../Projects/IDIAM/) sought to provide materials in multiple languages, however translation was a manual process.

Given the rapid improvement of the quality of automatic translation, it is now timely to use this to translate STACK questions between languages.  This case study reports our progress with automatic translation.

### Execution

### Results

### Challenges

One of the significant challenges is in deciding what to translate, and what to keep.   For example, we chose to keep variable names in the original language.
