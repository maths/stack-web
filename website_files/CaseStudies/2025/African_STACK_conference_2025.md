## Abstract

The **African STACK Conference for Undergraduate Mathematics** was held at **Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia, from August 4–8, 2025**, bringing together over 50 participants from 11 African countries alongside international collaborators from the UK, Germany, Italy, and the US. Building on earlier collaborations between Ethiopian universities, IDEMS, INNODEMS, and the African STACK community, the conference provided a platform for sharing experiences and innovations in digital assessment using STACK.

Sessions addressed diverse themes, including the introduction and expansion of STACK across African institutions, the development and localization of interactive open digital textbooks, and the integration of STACK into undergraduate teaching and postgraduate training. Case studies showcased applications such as Ethiopia's Exit Exam, remedial and foundational mathematics, Kenya's digital textbook assessments for Grades 7–10, and curriculum integration in Ghana. Key challenges identified included infrastructure limitations, capacity building, and scalability for large student populations.

International contributions, such as pilots at Caltech and multilingual STACK adoption at the University of Trieste, complemented African perspectives and emphasized the importance of collaboration and shared resources, including IDEMS' Open Question Banks and PreTeXt-based open digital textbooks. A central outcome of the conference was the recognition of open, interactive PreTeXt digital textbooks with STACK quizzes as a viable alternative in contexts with underutilized Learning Management Systems. Participants underscored the importance of sustained partnerships, resource sharing, and future collaborative events to accelerate the integration of STACK and foster innovation in mathematics education across Africa.

## Context and Motivation

The third African STACK Conference for Undergraduate Mathematics, held at Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia, marked a significant step forward in the continent's engagement with digital assessment. While the first two conferences focused on demonstrating STACK's potential and establishing a leadership network to guide its adoption, this third gathering deepened the conversation by showcasing concrete implementations and institutional experiences from across Africa, as well as potential areas of integration such as Francophone Africa.

The conference built upon a STACK workshop hosted at Bahir Dar two years earlier. Ethiopia's harmonized undergraduate curriculum requires all students to take a Basic Mathematics course, for which STACK practice materials were compiled during the 2023 workshop. However, adoption remained limited, as the requirement to create accounts on the Moodle learning management system presented a barrier. Recent developments, most notably the interoperability of STACK and PreTeXt digital textbooks, a possibility first discussed at the AIM workshop in Kenya in 2024, have created new opportunities to overcome this challenge and expand access.

The conference also highlighted the remarkable growth of STACK in Africa since its introduction in 2019, with over 78 courses now integrated across universities in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, and with keen interest from Ghana, Namibia, South Sudan, Cameroon, Botswana, and Somalia. Presentations showcased diverse applications, ranging from entrance and exit examinations to remedial mathematics and large service courses. Discussions also addressed persistent challenges, including scaling for large student populations, infrastructure gaps, and the need for ongoing capacity building.

Importantly, the conference broadened its thematic scope beyond assessment to include interactive PreTeXt digital textbooks, the expansion and review of IDEMS' Open Question Banks, and strategies to sustain high-quality assessment through collaboration. International contributions, particularly from Caltech and other global partners, enriched the dialogue and reinforced Africa's growing role in shaping STACK's global development trajectory.
