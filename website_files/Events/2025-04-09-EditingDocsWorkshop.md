# Contributing to the STACK documentation (with an introduction to Git) #

The STACK documentation is an important resource for new question authors learning to write questions, as well as for more experienced users looking for information on how to implement new or more advanced features (such as integrating JSXGraph or Parson’s problems). It’s therefore important for the documentation to be kept up-to-date, and completed with illustrative examples and explanations of important concepts. Whilst new features would usually be documented by the developers, the wider community can play an important role in contributing to the documentation, expanding areas that could be unclear, adding additional relevant examples, and fixing any typos or other errors when they occur. The STACK documentation is stored in the main STACK GitHub repository, and the version of the documentation available on the web (docs.stack-assessment.org) is then built automatically from this repository.

This workshop, run as part of the [The International Meeting of the STACK Community 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/stack2025/), aimed to provide a beginner’s introduction to Git and GitHub, and help attendees make their first (or next) contribution to the documentation.
