# Conference Format

The STACK conference will take place over five-days.  The aim is to blend academic presentations, hands-on workshops, community meetings, and opportunities for collaboration. The conference will include:

* whole-group sessions (keynote addresses);
* parallel presentations;
* plenary discussions; 
* poster walk through; 
* practical workshops on specific STACK features;
* shared breaks and some unstructured time for collaboration.

## Presentation Formats

The conference will include the traditional paper presentations, lightning talks, and poster presentations, grouped into thematic sessions.  Each thematic session will conclude with a 20–30 minute plenary discussion, moderated by the topic chair. This will bring together the ideas raised in the paper and lightning talks, allowing for additional questions, comments, and contributions from participants. 

#### Paper Presentations (25 minutes)

These sessions accommodate research findings, institutional case studies, technical developments, and substantial contributions to STACK practice or pedagogy.

#### Lightning Talks (10 minutes)

Short, focused presentations designed to share emerging ideas, tools, results, or provocations for discussion.

#### Posters

Posters will be displayed in common areas of the venue to provide an opportunity for visual communication of work in progress, exploratory ideas, practical tools, and other relevant work. A poster walk through will allow participants to engage with the authors.
