## Items discussed

### Development updates from Edmund:

* If a user opens a question that has Javascript, the editor will automatically swuitch to the plain text editor. 
 

* Ability to save broken question: tick a box to say that this is a broken question, save it but not display it to students. Hopefully this feature will be there on the next release. 

* Use API for embedding STACK questions in online resources (textbooks, notes).

* Gitsync plugin to allow export of moodle questions into a git repository. Will accomodate more targeted input and output. So you'll be able to import/export categories of questions, not nesessarily a whole course.

* Gitsync and Moodle 5 compatibility: basic compatibility at the moment. 

### Regular online STACK seminars.
A workshop on a specific aspect of STACK. Record them and have them in the community poge. Posible topics could be:
* numerical answers (how to deal with decimal places and significant figures), 
* Maxima flags, display order, negative signs that don't change your complex variables,
* How to deal with simplification.

### Bulk test: what else to include.
* Flag for videos (knowing if a video exists, mainly for copyright reasons).
* Check for file size.

### STACK 101 course: Interactive course or offline document?
Jonas shared a german Moodle course for STACK beginers: https://moodle.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/course/view.php?id=22225&lang=de
It starts with video tutorials for each topic. First it has a showcase which shows some features of STACK so that people become aware of what is possible and then there is a video how to create your 1st STACK question without randomization. It continues with some tutorials and sample tasks for randomization and feedback, and for each input type. The development of the videos is still ongoing. 

For now, Tim is updating the off-line STACK guide document. 


## Date for next meeting:
Thursday 26 of June 13.00 UK time.


Note: this meeting was recorded and the video was shared with the mambers of the Network.
