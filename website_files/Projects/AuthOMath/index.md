This project aimed to foster the development of innovative approaches to online and distance
learning especially in primary and secondary education.   In particular,  the project aims at enabling teachers to create digital online learning material with multimodal,
dynamic, and interactive elements, (GeoGebra) and with adaptive automatic feedback for use in hybrid settings.

The project provides an authoring tool (AuTo) and a didactic concept (DiCo) that teachers can use for creating digital online material in mathematics with
multi-modal, dynamic, interactive elements in task formulation and automated, adaptive
feedback. We combined two existing authoring tools that are well-established
in the mathematics educational community. [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) is an OER authoring
tool for creating multimodal, dynamic and interactive mathematical applets, with an easy
accessible user interface of widespread use in the mathematical educational community.
[STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) is an OER authoring tool
for randomized mathematical tasks with automatic, answer-based feedback.

Combining GeoGebra and STACK is a promising approach to developing an authoring tool for letting teachers create high-quality content. This outcome will be achieved by providing the following project results:

1. AuTo: An authoring tool for creating digital tasks with dynamic and interactive multi-modal elements and adaptive automatic feedback
2. DiCo: A didactical concept for the design of such tasks that takes the relevant mathematics educational research into account
