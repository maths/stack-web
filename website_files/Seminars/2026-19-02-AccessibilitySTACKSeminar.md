## Accessibility and STACK

**Speakers: Tim Lowe and Chris Hughes**

**Date:**  Thursday 19 Feb 2026, 
**Time:**  14.00 pm GMT (13.00 pm CET), the seminar will last for 1.5 hour
**Location:**  Online

We will discuss the visual accessibility of graphical and mathematical content within STACK questions. We will demonstrate how ALT-text and figure descriptions can be provided for figures, and how we have been producing these at The Open University.

We will also describe the accessibility features of MathJax used to display mathematics within STACK.  We will demonstrate how both figure descriptions and mathematics can be read and interacted with when using screen-reading software.
